    <p>Whoops, looks like something went wrong.</p>

    <p>A report with the error was sent to us, but sometimes it helps if we can know a little bit more about what you were doing.</p>

    <p>If you need further assistance, please contact us at hello@kanka.io or on the <a href="//reddit.com/r/kanka">r/kanka</a> subreddit.</p>
